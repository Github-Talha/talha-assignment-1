                    Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.
                    
                    Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.  Great staff could leave. Your program wonâ€™t reach as many young people as it could.</p>

                <p>is a broad concept denoting the idea that societies and countries have differing levels of economic or human development on an international scale. It is the basis for international classifications such as developed country, developing country and least developed country, and for a field of practice and research that in various ways engages with international development processes. There are, however, many schools of thought and conventions regarding which are the exact features constituting the "development" of a country.
